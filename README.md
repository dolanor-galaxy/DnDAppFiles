# DnDAppFiles

Files for the GM5 and Fight Club apps from Lion's Den.

## Pull Requests Welcome!

Please feel free to submit PR's. I want to foster and rebuild a community around the work to maintain this repo.

This is an actively maintained fork of the original repo by @ceryliae. Additionally, I periodically review others'
branches, and may merge them into this repo.

## Importable Compendiums

For your convenience, I have shared the importable compendiums in a Dropbox folder accessible with this link: https://goo.gl/t3Rbnh

All files will be kept up-to-date with every build made from the latest merges.

## Note!

Please do NOT use these files unless you know what you are doing. The files here are a work in progress, and are not guaranteed to work properly when imported.

Not all files use a format consumable by GM5 and Fight Club, in particular the various files under Classes use `<subclass>` and `<spellList>` tags that compile into standard format with the `create_compendiums.py` python script.

## Legal-ish

We are not affiliated with Leo or Lion's Den in any way.
